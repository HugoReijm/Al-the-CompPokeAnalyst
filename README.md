# Al-the-CompPokeAnalyst

Hey everyone! This is Al, my Competitive Pokemon Team Maker UI. It allows the user to see the current Meta in a given tier/format and build a team based on that information. It was built with the design of encouraging beginner or novice players to get a head start in the Competitive Pokemon realm. Hope it servers your needs

Al was written using Python 3.6 in pycharm. The data was copied from Smogon and its vast database and converted to JSON files for easy storage. As of yes, it can only be run by a python interpreter, but I have plans on making a GUI for it sometime in the future.
