# Al-the-CompPokeAnalyst

Hey everyone! This is Al, my Competitive Pokemon Team Maker UI. It allows the user to see the current Meta in a given tier/format and build a team based on that information. It was designed with the intention of encouraging beginner or novice players to get a head start in the Competitive Pokemon realm. The great thing is, after the user has made his/her team, he/she can save that team on their computer and import it into Pokemon Showdown! (http://pokemonshowdown.com/), a Pokemon Battle Simulator. However you use it, I hope it serves your needs.

Al was written using Python 3.6 in Pycharm. The data was copied from Smogon and its vast database and converted to JSON files for easy storage. As of yet, it can only be run by a python interpreter, but I have plans on making it an executable for Windows (sorry, Apple and Linux) sometime in the future.

As clarification, this program was made independently of Pokemon Showdown and is not affiliated with it. This program only encourages the use of Pokemon Showdown! should the user be interested in Competitive Pokemon play.
